# Ubuntu-Pomodoro-Timer

This is a short project I made since I wanted a good pomodoro timer, wanted more customization than other timers I used and wanted some practice with writing more Rust code. 

# Build
When in the cloned directory
> cargo build --release

# Help
For help with timer commands run
> cargo run -- --help
